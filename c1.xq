  ASSIGNMENT C1:

  Background:
  Consider land border crossings. Starting in Sweden, you can
  reach Norway and Finland with one border crossing. Russia with
  two. A whole host of countries with 3, and so on. This assumes,
  of course, that you are never allowed to double back over a
  border youâ€™ve crossed already.

  Assignment:
  Generate a list of all the countries that are reachable by land
  border crossing from Sweden under the above conditions, by showing:

  1) The countries that you can reach at each new border crossing
   and
  2) The crossing number for each such group of countries.
